# Sitecore.Support.53027
The patch allows Sitecore to take into account args.RedirectUrl parameters in speak.logout pipeline during Logout operations from the Launchpad and Experience Editor.
This, in turn, means that you can add your custom processors into the speak.logout and change the args.RedirectUrl parameter according to your needs.
